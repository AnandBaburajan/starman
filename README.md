# Starman
The bot is made with node.js, the [Twit NPM package](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) and uses Pak's
[Quote API](http://quote.machinu.net/api/) and the Cheerio module to get movie quotes from IMDb.

Starman is millions of miles away from Earth, drifting through deep space. This Twitter bot gives him voice.

Because in space, no one can hear you scream.
